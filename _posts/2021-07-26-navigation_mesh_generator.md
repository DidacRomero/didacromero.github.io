lead_text: 'This is the prototype that I developed for my final year project in which I made a small modular tool that was capable of generating a mesh from a Unity 2D grid map. The goal of this project is to provide a baseline for other programmers to experiment with different partitioning algorithms and to use adjacency graphs to code whatever path finding approach suits their needs.'
